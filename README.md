## Abstract
This paper examines the evolving focus on polyadic conversational agents (CAs) and the inherent challenges associated with exploring and contrasting existing research in this field. We present a detailed literature review that investigates the influence of polyadic CAs on various aspects of human-human interactions, encompassing communication, engagement, connection, and relationship maintenance. This research underscores the significance of the findings in guiding the design of future conversational agents and accentuates the imperative for more extensive research in this domain.

## Introduction
Conversational agents (CAs) have evolved from dyadic to polyadic interactions. Although dyadic CAs have received considerable attention, research on polyadic CAs, designed for group interactions, remains sparse. This introduction explores the inherent intricacies of evaluating polyadic CAs, the requirement to comprehend multiple user perspectives, and the multifaceted nature of assessing group dynamics. Furthermore, the significance of understanding polyadic CAs' impact on human-human interactions is underscored. This paper endeavors to present a thorough literature review in this regard and spotlight existing research gaps.

## Related Work
This section offers a comprehensive review of preceding research on conversational agents (CAs). It delves into the study of both dyadic and polyadic interactions, alongside user experience, engagement, and satisfaction. A concise history of CAs traces their evolution from rudimentary chatbots to advanced systems. The challenges linked with evaluating CAs are addressed, emphasizing the user experience's criticality, engagement, and satisfaction. This section summarizes the pivotal findings and delineates the gaps this paper seeks to bridge.

The results section consolidates the primary findings from our literature review. It starts by categorizing the polyadic CAs studied, moving on to describe the linguistic, prosodic, and dialogue features evaluated. The tasks-related and user-related metrics appraised are also detailed, along with a breakdown of the diverse evaluation methodologies applied across the reviewed studies.

## Discussion
Our discussion interprets the literature review's core findings, extracting implications for polyadic CAs' design and evaluation. The section underscores the essentiality of CAs supporting human-human interactions effectively. Furthermore, it elaborates on challenges in developing conversational AI technologies, emphasizing privacy, security, and ethical concerns. The segment concludes by pinpointing prospective research areas, urging for broader contextual exploration.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the paper revisits the pivotal findings, underlining the design and evaluation of polyadic CAs' implications. It emphasizes the potential of CAs in sectors like education and healthcare and points towards research areas that need further exploration. The culmination reiterates the necessity for relentless research in conversational AI, given its potential to redefine human-human interactions across multiple scenarios.
